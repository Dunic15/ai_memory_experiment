READING BEHAVIOR
================================================================================
Article 1 (Urban Heat Islands) - pre-reading mode:
  Reading Time: 2,796 ms (0.05 minutes = 2.80 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

Article 2 (Semiconductors) - synchronous mode:
  Reading Time: 26,591 ms (0.44 minutes = 26.59 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 3 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

Article 3 (CRISPR) - post-reading mode:
  Reading Time: 2,818 ms (0.05 minutes = 2.82 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

DATA VALIDITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
QUESTIONABLE DATA - Review required

Strengths:
  - High engagement (95%+ scroll depth)
  - Complete data for all phases

Minor Issues:
  - Semiconductors: Page visibility changes (participant may have switched tabs)
All recall responses are very short (<10 words)
Suspiciously short reading times detected

Recommendation: REVIEW before inclusion
  - Data quality concerns require investigation
  - May need to exclude from main analysis
