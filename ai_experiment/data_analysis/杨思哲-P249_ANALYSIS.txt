READING BEHAVIOR
================================================================================
Article 1 (CRISPR) - post-reading mode:
  Reading Time: 2,444 ms (0.04 minutes = 2.44 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

Article 2 (Urban Heat Islands) - pre-reading mode:
  Reading Time: 268,900 ms (4.48 minutes = 268.90 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

Article 3 (Semiconductors) - synchronous mode:
  Reading Time: 293,728 ms (4.90 minutes = 293.73 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.
