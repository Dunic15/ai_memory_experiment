## Key Findings

### ⚠️ Critical Data Quality Issues

1. **Extremely Short Reading Times:**
   - All three articles: 2.7-9.5 seconds (expected: ~12 minutes each)
   - **99% shorter than expected**
   - Indicates participant likely:
     - Used test/skip routes
     - Scrolled quickly without reading
     - Skipped reading entirely

2. **Non-Genuine Recall Responses:**
   - Article 1: "Cane" (dog in Italian)
   - Article 2: "cane" (same word)
   - Article 3: "222222222" and "CAN"
   - **All appear to be test inputs, not genuine recall**

3. **Duplicate Submissions:**
   - Article 3 has **two complete submissions** (recall + MCQ)
   - Suggests participant submitted twice or used test routes

4. **Empty AI Trust Reflection:**
   - All three open questions left completely blank
   - Indicates incomplete participation

5. **Scroll Depth vs Reading Time Mismatch:**
   - Scroll depth shows 100% for all articles
   - But reading times are too short for meaningful scrolling
   - Suggests automated scrolling or very fast scrolling without reading

### ✅ Valid Data Points

1. **Summary Viewing Times:**
   - Article 1 (post-reading): 1.73 minutes ✅
   - Article 2 (pre-reading): 1.21 minutes ✅
   - These are reasonable and valid measurements

2. **MCQ Responses:**
   - All questions answered in all attempts
   - Response patterns show variation (not all same answer)
   - Accuracy varies: 33.3% to 66.7%
   - Best performance on Article 3 (66.7% on first attempt)

3. **Experimental Conditions:**
   - Properly assigned: Integrated structure
   - All three timing conditions tested
   - Article order randomized correctly

### 📊 Performance Analysis

#### MCQ Performance by Article:
- **Article 1 (UHI):** 33.3% - Below chance, poor performance
- **Article 2 (Semiconductors):** 40.0% - Slightly above chance
- **Article 3 (CRISPR):** 66.7% (Attempt 1) - Good performance
- **Article 3 (CRISPR):** 40.0% (Attempt 2) - Slightly above chance

#### Summary Viewing Time:
- **Post-reading (Article 1):** 1.73 minutes
- **Pre-reading (Article 2):** 1.21 minutes
- **Difference:** Pre-reading summary viewed 30% shorter than post-reading
- **Note:** Only 2 data points (Article 3 had synchronous mode, no separate summary viewing)

#### Recall Quality:
- **All articles:** Only 1 word each
- **Confidence:** Varied (3/7 to 5/7)
- **Difficulty:** Varied (2/7 to 5/7)
- **Time:** Varied (7-81 seconds)

## Recommendations

### Data Validity Assessment:
**This appears to be TEST DATA, not a genuine participant response.**

### Exclusion Criteria Met:
1. ✅ Extremely short reading times (< 1% of expected)
2. ✅ Non-serious recall responses (test inputs)
3. ✅ Duplicate submissions
4. ✅ Empty required fields (AI trust reflection)

### Recommendation:
**EXCLUDE from main analysis** OR **Mark as test data**

### If Including in Analysis:
1. **Use only valid data points:**
   - Summary viewing times (1.73 min, 1.21 min)
   - MCQ responses (but note test behavior)
   
2. **Exclude:**
   - Reading times (too short to be meaningful)
   - Recall responses (test inputs)
   - Duplicate Article 3 submissions (use only first attempt)

3. **Note in analysis:**
   - Mark as test/development data
   - Explain data quality issues
   - Use cautiously for summary viewing time analysis only

---

## Conclusion

Participant P061's data shows clear signs of **testing/development behavior**:
- Reading times are orders of magnitude shorter than expected
- Recall responses are test inputs, not genuine recall
- Duplicate submissions for Article 3
- Empty AI trust reflection
- Overall experiment duration (~10 minutes) is far too short for genuine participation

**The only reliable data points are:**
- Summary viewing times (1.73 min post-reading, 1.21 min pre-reading)
- MCQ responses (though accuracy varies and may reflect test behavior)

**Recommendation:** Mark as test data and exclude from main analysis, or use only summary viewing times if including in analysis.
