  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 10 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.
  Note: 2 reading_complete entries logged (63,770 ms, 58,439 ms)
