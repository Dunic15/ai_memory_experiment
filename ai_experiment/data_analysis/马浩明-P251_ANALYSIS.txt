READING BEHAVIOR
================================================================================
Article 1 (Urban Heat Islands) - pre-reading mode:
  Reading Time: 414,610 ms (6.91 minutes = 414.61 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

Article 2 (Semiconductors) - post-reading mode:
  Reading Time: 642,623 ms (10.71 minutes = 642.62 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
    This can happen if the participant switches tabs, minimizes the window, or the OS
    switches to another application. It's normal behavior but may indicate distractions.

Article 3 (CRISPR) - synchronous mode:
  Reading Time: 484,632 ms (8.08 minutes = 484.63 seconds)
  Scroll Depth: 100%
  Visibility Changes: 1 (page was hidden/shown during reading)
    Note: Visibility changes occur when the browser tab/window loses or regains focus.
