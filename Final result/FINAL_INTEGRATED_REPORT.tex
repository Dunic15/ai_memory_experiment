\section{Executive Summary}
% ============================================

This experiment investigated how AI-generated summaries affect learning and memory, with a focus on \textbf{when} (timing) and \textbf{how} (structure) summaries are presented. The findings reveal that the cognitive consequences of AI assistance depend critically on these design choices---not merely on whether AI is used.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=mainblue,title=Key Takeaway]
\textbf{AI can meaningfully improve learning outcomes when aligned with cognitive principles of timing, structure, and task demands.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Baseline (AI vs No-AI).}
Across all MCQs, the AI group outperformed the No-AI group (AI: $0.598 \pm 0.085$, No-AI: $0.510 \pm 0.098$; $F(1, 34) = 7.86$, $p = .008$, $\eta^2_p = .188$), establishing a general recognition benefit of AI assistance.

% ============================================
\section{Main Findings}
% ============================================

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Main Finding 1: Pre-Reading Timing Produces Superior MCQ Performance}
% --------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{The Finding}
\textbf{When ``AI-assisted memory'' is indexed to the information provided by the AI summary (\textit{AI-summary-sourced} questions; \textit{ai\_summary\_accuracy}), pre-reading access produces substantially higher accuracy than synchronous or post-reading access.} This summary-specific advantage is consistent with (and statistically accounts for) the overall MCQ timing benefit.

\subsubsection{Statistical Evidence}

\paragraph{Primary outcome (AI group; AI-summary-sourced accuracy, $n = 24$ per timing):}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Timing Condition} & \textbf{AI Summary Accuracy (Mean $\pm$ SD)} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Pre-reading} & \textbf{0.833 $\pm$ 0.141} \\
Synchronous & 0.568 $\pm$ 0.239 \\
Post-reading & 0.641 $\pm$ 0.196 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{AI Summary Accuracy by Timing Condition}
\end{table}

\noindent\textit{See Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:mf1-plots} for the corresponding plots.}

\paragraph{Mixed ANOVA (Structure $\times$ Timing; AI-summary-sourced accuracy, AI Group):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timing main effect:} $F(2, 44) = 14.00$, $p = 1.97\times 10^{-5}$, $\eta^2_p = .389$
    \item Structure main effect: $F(1, 22) = 0.06$, $p = .802$ (ns)
    \item Interaction: $F(2, 44) = 0.61$, $p = .547$ (ns)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Post-hoc Pairwise Comparisons (Holm-corrected):}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{p-value} & \textbf{Cohen's $d_z$} \\
\midrule
Pre vs Synchronous & +0.266 & .00052 & $d_z = 0.91$ \\
Pre vs Post & +0.193 & .00057 & $d_z = 0.87$ \\
Synchronous vs Post & $-$0.073 & .148 & $d_z = -0.31$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Pairwise Comparisons for AI Summary Accuracy}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Overall MCQ accuracy (for context).}
The same ordering appears for \textit{overall} MCQ accuracy (all questions): pre-reading $0.699 \pm 0.125$, synchronous $0.533 \pm 0.147$, post-reading $0.562 \pm 0.127$; Mixed ANOVA shows a significant timing effect ($F(1.77, 38.87) = 11.77$, $p = .00018$).

\subsubsection{Mechanism: Summary-Specific Encoding and Advance Organizers}

\paragraph{Summary-specific mechanism (model-based evidence).}
AI summary accuracy strongly predicts overall MCQ accuracy in a mixed-effects model controlling for timing and structure ($\beta = 0.472$, $p < .001$). When \textit{ai\_summary\_accuracy} is added to the model, the pre-reading MCQ advantage shrinks substantially (pre--sync: $\Delta = 0.172 \rightarrow 0.043$; pre--post: $\Delta = 0.143 \rightarrow 0.044$) and is no longer significant after Holm correction ($p = .352$). Model fit improves markedly ($\chi^2(1) = 46.38$, $p < .001$).

\paragraph{Boundary condition: article-only comprehension.}
Timing does \textit{not} affect article-only accuracy ($p = .706$), consistent with the timing manipulation primarily changing learning for summary-covered information rather than broadly improving article-only comprehension.

\paragraph{Not just ``more time'': timing remains after controlling summary exposure.}\par
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\makebox[\textwidth][c]{%
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Pre--Sync Estimate} & \textbf{Pre--Post Estimate} \\
\midrule
Base (timing only) & 0.271*** & 0.214*** \\
$+$ log(summary\_time) & 0.258*** & 0.164** \\
\textbf{Reduction} & \textbf{5\%} & \textbf{23\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\caption{Timing contrasts on AI-summary accuracy with and without summary time control}
\end{table}

\textbf{Summary time effect:} $\beta = 0.062$, $p = .031$.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Timing remains highly significant even after controlling for summary time. Pre-reading wins because of \textbf{quality of processing}, not just quantity of time.

Why does pre-reading work? The summary functions as an \textbf{advance organizer} \citep{ausubel1960}, providing a high-level framework that guides attention during reading and reduces extraneous cognitive load \citep{sweller1988,chandler1992}.

\textbf{Advance Organizer Theory} \citep{ausubel1960}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Activates relevant schemas before encoding
    \item Provides a ``cognitive map'' that guides attention during reading
    \item Reduces extraneous cognitive load \citep{sweller1988,chandler1992}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Main Finding 2: Integrated Summaries Reduce False Memory Endorsement}
% --------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{The Finding}
\textbf{Summary structure---not timing---is the primary driver of susceptibility to false AI-generated claims. Integrated summaries yield higher false-lure accuracy (better rejection of misinformation) and fewer false lures selected, whereas segmented summaries approximately \textbf{double} the probability of endorsing false lures.}

\subsubsection{Statistical Evidence}

\paragraph{Descriptive Statistics (AI Group):}

\begin{tabular}{lcc}

\begin{itemize}

    \item False-lure accuracy: structure main effect $F(1, 22) = 4.20$, $p = .053$; timing and interaction ns.
\end{itemize}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Binomial GLMM Results for False Lure Endorsement}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Mechanism: Source Monitoring and Split-Attention}

Why do segmented summaries increase false memories?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Weaker source monitoring cues:} Fragmented presentation reduces contextual cues used to attribute information to its correct source \citep{johnson1993}
    \item \textbf{Reduced cross-checking:} Separated information discourages verification against the original article
    \item \textbf{Split-attention costs:} Dividing attention across separated elements taxes cognitive resources and impairs integration \citep{sweller1988,chandler1992}
    \item \textbf{Automation bias and misinformation:} Readers may accept AI-generated content with insufficient verification, increasing susceptibility to misinformation \citep{zhai2024,gerlich2025,loftuspalmer1974,loftus2005,chan2024}
\end{enumerate}

Overall, these results align with established accounts in which presentation format affects information integration and source attribution. Integrated summaries better support coherent mental model construction---reflected in both \textit{higher false-lure accuracy} and \textit{fewer misguidances}---whereas segmented summaries increase the risk of misattributing plausible but incorrect information \citep{johnson1993,sweller1988,chandler1992,loftus2005}.

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Main Finding 3 (Process Evidence): Pre-reading Increases Summary Engagement Without Increasing Total Time}
% --------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{The Finding}
\textbf{The timing manipulation changed how participants allocated time between the AI summary and the article.} Pre-reading produced the greatest summary viewing time and summary share, synchronous was intermediate, and post-reading was lowest. Total reading time did not differ across timing conditions, indicating a redistribution of attention rather than increased overall engagement.

This pattern is consistent with the idea that earlier access increases exposure to an advance organizer, which may support downstream encoding during article reading.

\paragraph{Mixed ANOVA (Structure $\times$ Timing; AI group).}
\textbf{Main effects.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summary time (s):} main effect of timing, $F(2, 43.25) = 13.32$, $p < .001$, $\eta^2_p = .381$; no structure effect, no interaction.
    \item \textbf{Summary share:} main effect of timing, $F(2, 43.25) = 16.20$, $p < .001$, $\eta^2_p = .428$; no structure effect, no interaction.
    \item \textbf{Reading time (min):} no timing effect, $F(2, 43.25) = 1.16$, $p = .324$; no structure effect, no interaction.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Post hocs (Holm-corrected).}
Pre-reading $>$ synchronous $>$ post-reading for both summary time and summary share (all adjusted $p \le .021$). Reading time shows no pairwise differences (all adjusted $p > .32$).

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\caption{Structure $\times$ timing descriptives (AI group).}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Overall context.}
Across AI trials, average reading time is 7.20 minutes (vs.\ 8.26 in No-AI), and the summary occupies 19.3\% of total reading time on average (integrated 19.2\%, segmented 19.5\%).

\paragraph{Does longer article reading improve article-only learning?}
Reading time did not predict article-only accuracy in the AI group (mixed model controlling for timing and structure; $F(1, 64.37) = 0.07$, $p = .787$), suggesting that timing effects are not driven by greater article reading. Reading time was log-transformed to reduce skew.

\textbf{Theoretical Connection: Advance Organizers and Load Allocation}\\[0.3cm]
These results align with advance-organizer and cognitive-load accounts: earlier access increases exposure to a high-level scaffold before or during reading, which may support schema-consistent encoding while reading the article \citep{ausubel1960,sweller1988,chandler1992}.

Critically, timing changed how time was allocated rather than how much time was spent, isolating attention distribution as the key process affected by the manipulation.

\paragraph{Link to the learning advantage.}
The ordering of summary engagement (pre-reading $>$ synchronous $>$ post-reading) matches the ordering of the timing benefit on learning outcomes, consistent with a mechanism in which earlier access increases exposure to the organizer at the point where it can shape encoding during the article phase. However, because timing remains significant even after controlling for summary time, this process evidence should be interpreted as \textit{contributory} rather than as a complete explanation: the advantage is likely driven by both exposure and higher-quality processing when the organizer is encountered earlier.

\paragraph{Connection to prior advance-organizer research.}
Classic work shows that presenting an organizer before a technical text improves downstream comprehension and memory organization \citep{mayerbromage1980,hartleydavies1976}. Preview structures such as headings and topic sentences similarly guide attention and improve organization \citep{lorchlorch1996}. The present time-allocation results provide a direct process trace consistent with these accounts: participants devoted the greatest share of attention to the organizer under pre-reading, despite no increase in total time-on-task.

\paragraph{Robustness note (primary effects).}
Design and modelling sensitivity checks (including counterbalancing, article-interaction tests, leave-one-article-out re-estimation, and alternative model specifications) support the stability of the primary conclusions; see Section~\ref{sec:design-robustness}.

% ============================================
\section{Secondary Finding: Post-Block Trust/Dependence Support the Timing Mechanism}
% ============================================

\subsection{How This Supports the Main Findings}

Trust and dependence were assessed \textit{after each reading block} (as post-block states, not pre-task traits). This provides converging subjective evidence about perceived reliance under the six AI assistance conditions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supports Main Finding 3 (process evidence):} Pre-reading is the condition with the highest summary engagement (summary share), and it is also the condition with the highest perceived reliance (both trust and dependence). Together, these results support the interpretation that pre-reading summaries function as a stronger scaffold/organizer during encoding.
    \item \textbf{Complements Main Finding 1 (timing advantage):} The same timing ordering observed in learning outcomes (pre-reading best) is mirrored in subjective reliance, consistent with the idea that earlier access increases reliance on the organizer at the point where it can shape encoding.
    \item \textbf{Boundary for Main Finding 2 (misinformation):} Although dependence is higher in segmented, trust does not reliably differ by structure, and exploratory models show trust/dependence do not predict false-lure selection. Therefore, the structure-driven misinformation effect should not be framed as a simple ``over-trust'' account with these post-block measures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Evidence (AI Group; Mixed Design Models)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trust:} timing $F(2, 43) = 7.90$, $p = .001$; structure $p = .222$; interaction $p = .194$.
    \item \textbf{Dependence:} structure $F(1, 22) = 6.21$, $p = .021$; timing $F(2, 43) = 7.74$, $p = .001$; interaction $p = .559$.

\section{Integrated Interpretation}
% ============================================

\subsection{Two Independent Cognitive Pathways: Timing and Structure Effects}

The results support two largely independent pathways consistent with established cognitive theories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timing $\rightarrow$ AI-summary-sourced accuracy (and overall MCQ):} Pre-reading summaries function as advance organizers that prime schemas and guide attention during encoding, primarily improving learning for summary-covered information \citep{ausubel1960,sweller1988,chandler1992}.
    \item \textbf{Structure $\rightarrow$ false-lure endorsement:} Segmented formats increase split-attention and weaken source-monitoring cues, elevating susceptibility to plausible but incorrect information \citep{johnson1993,chandler1992,loftus2005}.
\end{itemize}

A broader synthesis using the proposed \textit{AI Buffer} concept is developed in the Discussion chapter, where it is explicitly presented as an interpretive framework rather than as an empirical result.

\subsection{The Optimal Design Configuration}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Optimal Choice} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
Timing & Pre-reading & Highest AI-summary accuracy; large MCQ benefit ($d > 1.3$) \\
Structure & Integrated & Dramatically lower false-lure risk (OR = 6$\times$ safer) \\
Format & Coherent paragraphs & Supports source monitoring \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Optimal AI Summary Design}
\end{table}

\textbf{Expected outcomes for Pre-reading + Integrated:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MCQ accuracy: $\sim$0.75 (highest)
    \item False lures selected: $\sim$0.58/article (lower is better)
    \item False-lure accuracy: $\sim$0.56 (higher is better)
\end{itemize}

% ============================================
\section{Experimental Design Robustness}
% ============================================
\label{sec:design-robustness}

\noindent\textit{See Supplementary Figures \ref{fig:robustness-plots} and \ref{fig:robustness-loao} for the corresponding plots.}

\paragraph{Goal of these checks.}
Because timing is manipulated \emph{within} participants while articles differ in baseline difficulty, we verify that (i) timing is not confounded with article assignment, (ii) timing effects generalize across articles, and (iii) conclusions are stable under reasonable alternative model choices (e.g., adding time-on-task covariates or using count models where appropriate).

\paragraph{Design integrity (complete cells).}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Design Feature} & \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Evidence} \\
\midrule
Sample size & N = 36 (24 AI, 12 No-AI) & 108 article-level observations \\
Within-subjects balance & \checkmark Complete & Each AI participant: 3 trials \\
Between-subjects balance & \checkmark Complete & 12 integrated, 12 segmented \\
Article exposure & \checkmark Complete & All participants see all 3 articles \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Design Integrity Summary}
\end{table}

These checks confirm full coverage of articles and balanced assignment across structure and timing, reducing the risk that effects are artifacts of missing cells or uneven exposure.

\paragraph{Stimulus variability (article difficulty).}
\paragraph{Difficulty index (overall MCQ accuracy; all participants, $n = 36$ per article).}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Article} & \textbf{Overall MCQ Accuracy (Mean $\pm$ SD)} \\
\midrule
Semiconductors & 0.480 $\pm$ 0.170 (hardest) \\
UHI & 0.601 $\pm$ 0.144 \\
CRISPR & 0.625 $\pm$ 0.134 (easiest) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Article Difficulty Index (Overall MCQ Accuracy; All Participants)}
\end{table}

The difficulty gradient is stable (Semiconductors hardest, CRISPR easiest), indicating that article difficulty varies substantially but in a consistent direction across the sample.

\paragraph{AI group breakdown (for reference).}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Article} & \textbf{MCQ Accuracy} & \textbf{Summary Acc.} & \textbf{False Lures} \\
\midrule
Semiconductors & 0.524 (hardest) & 0.562 & 0.833 \\
UHI & 0.622 & 0.760 & 0.958 (most) \\
CRISPR & 0.649 (easiest) & 0.719 & 0.667 (fewest) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Article-Level Performance (AI Group; selected outcomes)}
\end{table}

The same ordering appears across outcomes in the AI group, suggesting that difficulty differences are article-driven rather than condition-specific.

\textbf{Observation:} Semiconductors is consistently the most difficult article across outcomes.

\paragraph{Counterbalancing and generalization across articles.}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Check} & \textbf{Question} & \textbf{Result} & \textbf{Evidence} \\
\midrule
Counterbalancing & Article independent of timing? & \checkmark Yes & $\chi^2(4) = 3.00$, $p = .558$ \\
Interaction & Timing depend on article? & \checkmark No & $F < 1.88$, $p > .12$ \\
LOAO Robustness & Effect survives dropping any article? & \checkmark Yes & All $p < .02$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Design Validity Summary}
\end{table}

Together, these checks show that timing effects are not driven by article assignment, do not vary by article, and persist when any single article is removed.

\paragraph{Counterbalancing distribution (Timing $\times$ Article).}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Timing} & \textbf{CRISPR} & \textbf{Semiconductors} & \textbf{UHI} \\
\midrule
Pre-reading & 8 & 9 & 7 \\
Synchronous & 10 & 8 & 6 \\
Post-reading & 6 & 7 & 11 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Article $\times$ Timing Distribution (counterbalancing)}
\end{table}

The distribution is near-uniform across timing conditions, avoiding systematic alignment of any article with a single timing condition.

\textbf{Chi-square test:} $\chi^2(4) = 3.00$, $p = .558$

\textbf{Result:} Counterbalancing is adequate ($p > .05$). Article assignment does not confound timing conditions.

\caption{Leave-one-article-out robustness for the pre-reading MCQ advantage}

Each leave-one-article-out estimate remains positive and significant, indicating the timing advantage is not driven by any single article.

\textbf{Result:} The pre-reading timing effect is robust regardless of which article is excluded.

\paragraph{Additional robustness evidence from the broader analysis set.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No time-on-task confound for timing:} timing does not affect reading time (\(F(2, 43.25)=1.16\), \(p=.324\)), total time (\(F(2, 43.25)=0.01\), \(p=.992\)), or mental effort (\(F(2, 42.24)=1.50\), \(p=.236\)). Thus, the timing effects on learning are unlikely to be explained by simply spending more time or reporting higher effort.
    \item \textbf{AI vs No-AI benefit generalizes across articles:} the group effect on MCQ accuracy does not depend on article (\(F(2,68)=0.56\), \(p=.573\)).
    \item \textbf{Structure effect on misinformation is not explained by engagement:} in a sensitivity model treating \texttt{false\_lures\_selected} as a Poisson count and adding \texttt{mental\_effort}, \texttt{reading\_time\_min}, and \texttt{summary\_time\_sec}, structure remains significant (\(p=.031\)) while the added covariates are not (\(p \ge .139\)).
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Grounding}
% ============================================

\subsection{Main Finding 1: Pre-Reading Timing Effect}

\subsubsection{Advance Organizer Theory}

The pre-reading advantage aligns with \textbf{Ausubel's Advance Organizer Theory} \citep{ausubel1960,ausubel1968}:

\begin{quote}
``The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach him accordingly.'' --- David Ausubel
\end{quote}

\textbf{Core mechanism:} Advance organizers provide a cognitive framework that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Activates relevant prior knowledge (schema priming)
    \item Creates ``ideational scaffolding'' for new information
    \item Guides selective attention during subsequent reading
    \item Facilitates meaningful learning over rote memorization \citep{craik1972}
\end{enumerate}

Empirical validation comes from Mayer \& Bromage (1980), who found pre-reading outlines improved problem-solving by $\sim$25\%, and Hartley \& Davies (1976), who demonstrated pre-organizer benefits for recall.

\subsubsection{Cognitive Load Theory}

The pre-reading effect aligns with \textbf{Cognitive Load Theory} \citep{sweller1988}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intrinsic load:} Reduced because summary simplifies article processing
    \item \textbf{Extraneous load:} Reduced because learners don't need to ``figure out what matters'' \citep{chandler1992}
    \item \textbf{Germane load:} Increased because resources are freed for schema construction
\end{itemize}

The working memory model \citep{baddeley2012,atkinson1968} provides the cognitive architecture: the AI summary reduces demands on the central executive by pre-organizing information before it enters the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Alignment}

Our observed effect size ($d = 1.35$--$1.62$) is larger than typical advance organizer effects ($d \approx 0.20$--$0.50$), likely because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item AI summaries are more comprehensive than traditional organizers
    \item The MCQ outcome is particularly sensitive to schema-guided encoding
    \item The within-subjects design increased statistical power
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Main Finding 2: Integrated Structure and False Memory Resistance}

\subsubsection{Source Monitoring Framework}

The structure effect aligns with the \textbf{Source Monitoring Framework} \citep{johnson1993,lindsayjohnson1989}:

\begin{quote}
``Source monitoring refers to the set of processes involved in making attributions about the origins of memories, knowledge, and beliefs.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Empirical pattern:} Integrated summaries show higher false-lure accuracy (0.556 vs.\ 0.375) and fewer false lures selected (0.58 vs.\ 1.06) than segmented summaries.

\textbf{Core mechanism:} Segmented summaries increase source confusion because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fragmented presentation disrupts coherent mental model construction
    \item Spatial separation increases misattribution risk \citep{chandler1992}
    \item Reduced cross-referencing makes verification harder
\end{enumerate}

Recent research demonstrates that conversational AI can amplify false memories in witness interviews \citep{chan2024}, extending classical misinformation effects to AI-generated content.

\subsubsection{The DRM Paradigm}

Our false-lure manipulation parallels the \textbf{Deese-Roediger-McDermott Paradigm} \citep{roediger1995}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Critical lures falsely recognized at 40--60\% (similar to our 54\% segmented rate)
    \item False recognition confidence often as high as for true items
    \item Effect robust across age groups and cultures
\end{itemize}

Meta-analytic evidence \citep{frenda2011} suggests misinformation effects typically produce OR $\approx$ 3--5, consistent with our OR = 5.93 for the structure effect.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy-Trace Theory}

\textbf{Fuzzy-Trace Theory} \citep{brainerdreyna2005} explains the mechanism:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integrated format:} Encourages better verbatim encoding, enabling rejection of false claims
    \item \textbf{Segmented format:} Primarily encodes gist, which supports false recognition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Main Finding 3 (Process Evidence): Pre-reading Increases Summary Engagement Without Increasing Total Time}

\subsubsection{Advance Organizer Exposure}

Advance organizers are most effective when encountered \textit{before} the target material because they provide a framework that guides subsequent selection, integration, and encoding \citep{ausubel1960,mayerbromage1980,hartleydavies1976}. Preview structures (e.g., headings and topic sentences) similarly guide attention and improve organization \citep{lorchlorch1996}. The observed increase in summary viewing time and share under pre-reading indicates greater exposure to the organizer at the point where it can shape processing during the article phase.

\subsubsection{Allocation of Attention (Not Time-on-Task)}

Cognitive load accounts emphasize that learning depends on how limited cognitive resources are allocated, not simply on total time spent \citep{sweller1988}. Because total time did not change across timing conditions, the process evidence is best interpreted as a redistribution of attention toward the summary rather than increased overall engagement. This aligns with the idea that early access reduces extraneous load by clarifying what to attend to during reading, thereby lowering search and integration costs during the article phase \citep{chandler1992}.

\section{Conclusions and Design Implications}
% ============================================

\subsection{For Educational Technology Design}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Default to pre-reading summaries} when the goal is comprehension/MCQ performance
    \item \textbf{Use integrated (not segmented) format} to minimize false memory risk
    \item \textbf{Treat false lures as a structural UI risk}, not a user trait problem
    \item \textbf{Instrument summary engagement:} timing shifts attention allocation without increasing total time
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{For Future Research}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Test \textbf{delayed retention} (24h, 1 week) to assess consolidation
    \item Manipulate \textbf{summary factuality} directly to test safety/performance trade-offs
    \item Use \textbf{process tracing} (eye-tracking, think-aloud) to isolate source-monitoring mechanisms
    \item Explore \textbf{verification affordances} (citations, uncertainty markers) as misinformation countermeasures
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Takeaway}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=mainblue,title=Core Message]
\textbf{AI can meaningfully improve learning outcomes when aligned with cognitive principles of timing, structure, and task demands.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-reading timing} enhances comprehension quality through schema activation
    \item \textbf{Integrated structure} protects against false memory through coherent representation
    \item \textbf{Timing reallocates attention} toward the summary (greater exposure) without increasing time-on-task
    \item The optimal design is \textbf{pre-reading + integrated}: maximum learning benefit with manageable misinformation risk
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Importantly, this study demonstrates that AI-generated summaries can produce large and reliable learning benefits, comparable to or exceeding classic instructional interventions, when embedded within cognitively informed designs.}

\section{Prior Experiments with Similar Designs: Empirical Validation}
% ============================================

This section highlights prior experiments that align with our three primary results: timing/advance organizers improve learning, structure affects misinformation vulnerability, and earlier access changes attention allocation toward the organizer.

\subsection{Pre-Reading/Advance Organizer Studies}

\textbf{Mayer \& Bromage (1980):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Pre-reading outline vs. post-reading outline for technical passages
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Pre-reading outline improved conceptual problem-solving by $\sim$25\%
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Same timing manipulation (pre vs. post), similar outcome pattern
    \item \textbf{Our replication:} Pre-reading improved MCQ by +16.7\% vs. synchronous, +13.7\% vs. post-reading
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hartley \& Davies (1976):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Pre-organizer vs. no organizer for educational texts
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Pre-organizers improved retention of main ideas
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Pre-reading scaffold enhances subsequent learning
    \item \textbf{Our replication:} Pre-reading produced highest summary accuracy and MCQ performance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lorch \& Lorch (1996):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Topic sentences before vs. after paragraphs
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Pre-topic sentences improved text memory organization
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Analogous ``preview'' manipulation affecting text comprehension
    \item \textbf{Our replication:} Pre-reading AI summary functions as a comprehensive topic preview
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Process Evidence: Attention Allocation and Organizer Exposure}

Most classic organizer studies evaluate outcomes (test performance, comprehension) rather than the allocation process itself. Our third main finding extends this literature by directly measuring organizer engagement: pre-reading produces the highest summary viewing time and share, while total time remains constant. This provides a process-level trace consistent with organizer and cognitive-load accounts.

\subsection{False Memory and Misinformation Studies}

\textbf{Roediger \& McDermott (1995) -- DRM Paradigm:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Word lists with semantically related critical lures
    \item \textbf{Finding:} $\sim$40--55\% false recognition of critical lures
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Our false lures are semantically plausible and produce similar rates (54\% in segmented)
    \item \textbf{Our contribution:} Extended DRM-like effects to AI-generated educational misinformation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Loftus \& Palmer (1974):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Post-event leading questions (``How fast were the cars going when they \textit{smashed}?'')
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Wording of post-event information altered memory
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Post-reading AI summary can distort memory of article content
    \item \textbf{Our parallel:} Post-reading + segmented shows highest false lure endorsement
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lindsay \& Johnson (1989):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Source monitoring for misinformation from different sources
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Poor source monitoring increased misinformation susceptibility
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Our structure manipulation affects source monitoring ability
    \item \textbf{Our contribution:} Demonstrated that UI design (integrated vs. segmented) affects source monitoring
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Frenda, Nichols, \& Loftus (2011):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Review of misinformation effect across various conditions
    \item \textbf{Finding:} OR $\approx$ 3--5 for misinformation effects in various formats
    \item \textbf{Our replication:} OR = 5.93 for segmented vs. integrated format
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Split-Attention and Integration Studies}

\textbf{Chandler \& Sweller (1992):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Integrated vs. split-source instructional materials
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Integrated instruction improved learning and reduced cognitive load
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Same integrated vs. segmented manipulation
    \item \textbf{Our contribution:} Extended to AI-generated content and false memory outcomes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pociask \& Morrison (2008):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Design:} Split-attention vs. integrated materials for cognitive and psychomotor tasks \citep{pociask2008}
    \item \textbf{Finding:} Integrated materials produced higher test scores
    \item \textbf{Similarity:} Same structure manipulation, similar learning benefit
    \item \textbf{Our parallel:} Integrated format produces both better learning and lower false memory
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Novel Contributions Beyond Prior Research}

While our findings are consistent with prior research, we contribute several \textbf{novel extensions}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{AI-generated content context:} Prior research used human-created organizers; we extend to AI-generated summaries
    \item \textbf{False lure methodology:} We combine DRM-like false recognition with realistic educational misinformation
    \item \textbf{Timing $\times$ Structure manipulation:} Most studies manipulate one factor; we examine their independent and joint effects
    \item \textbf{Process evidence:} We directly measure summary exposure (time and share) to validate the timing mechanism
    \item \textbf{Practical AI design implications:} We translate theoretical findings into concrete UI/UX recommendations for AI-assisted learning tools

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Secondary Finding A: Recall Performance Is Unaffected by Timing (MCQ-Recall Dissociation)}
% --------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{The Finding}
\textbf{While timing dramatically affects MCQ performance, free recall is completely unaffected across all timing conditions.} This represents a fundamental dissociation between recognition and generative retrieval.

\subsubsection{Statistical Evidence}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Timing} & \textbf{Recall Total Score (Mean $\pm$ SD)} \\
\midrule
Pre-reading & 5.50 $\pm$ 1.92 \\
Synchronous & 5.54 $\pm$ 1.99 \\
Post-reading & 5.56 $\pm$ 2.17 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Recall Scores by Timing (Difference $<$ 0.06 points)}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Mixed ANOVA (Structure $\times$ Timing, AI Group):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timing:} $F(1.86, 40.88) = 0.03$, $p = .969$, $\eta^2_G < .001$
    \item Structure: $F(1, 22) = 0.40$, $p = .536$
    \item Interaction: $F(1.86, 40.88) = 0.62$, $p = .532$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The MCQ-Recall Dissociation}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Timing Effect} & \textbf{Effect Size} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
MCQ Accuracy & Strong ($p < .001$) & $d = 1.35$--$1.62$ & Recognition benefits from schema priming \\
Recall Score & None ($p = .97$) & $d \approx 0$ & Generative retrieval not enhanced \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{MCQ-Recall Dissociation Summary}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Mechanism: Different Memory Processes and Task Demands}

This dissociation reflects a fundamental distinction in how memory operates, explained by classical dual-process theories \citep{jacoby1991} and by differences in retrieval demands across tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{MCQ = cue-supported recognition:} When answer options are available, learners can rely on familiarity-based recognition. Pre-reading summaries supply organizational cues that increase the accessibility of relevant concepts, facilitating correct option selection.
    
    \item \textbf{Recall = self-generated retrieval:} Free recall requires learners to actively reconstruct information from memory without external cues \citep{craik1972}. Without active generation during study, gains in recognition do not necessarily translate into stronger recall.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Interpretation:} The timing manipulation selectively benefits tasks where retrieval cues are available, such as recognition tests, but does not strengthen the internally generated memory traces required for free recall. This pattern aligns with transfer-appropriate processing and retrieval-practice accounts.

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Secondary Finding B: AI Improves MCQ But Not Recall}
% --------------------------------------------

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Measure} & \textbf{With AI} & \textbf{No AI} & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{Effect Size} \\
\midrule
MCQ Accuracy & 0.598 & 0.510 & +0.088 & $d = 0.57$ ($p = .008$) \\
Recall Score & 5.535 & 5.403 & +0.132 & ns ($p > .50$) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{AI vs No-AI Comparison}
\end{table}

\textbf{Interpretation:} AI selectively enhances performance on tasks that align with AI-provided information (MCQs referencing the summary), but does not improve generative recall.

\textbf{Theoretical Connection: Encoding Specificity Principle}\\[0.3cm]
This pattern aligns with Tulving's \textbf{Encoding Specificity Principle} \citep{tulvingthomson1973}:
\begin{quote}
``What is stored is determined by what is perceived and how it is encoded, and what is stored determines what retrieval cues are effective.''
\end{quote}

AI summaries provide encoding that is \textbf{transfer-appropriate} for MCQ (recognition with cues) but not for free recall (generative retrieval without cues). The AI content becomes part of the encoded memory trace, making AI-related MCQ cues more effective.

\textbf{Related Theory: Cognitive Offloading and External Memory Aids}\\[0.3cm]
The AI summary functions as an \textbf{external memory aid} \citep{gerlich2025,risko2016}, where learners encode \textit{where} information is stored (the AI) rather than the information itself---a phenomenon increasingly relevant in the digital age \citep{sparrow2011,gong2024,firth2019}. Recent research on AI and cognition \citep{bai2023} confirms that generative AI tools alter how users encode and retrieve information, consistent with cognitive offloading accounts.

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Secondary Finding D: Mental Effort Is Not a Confound}
% --------------------------------------------

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Mental Effort (1--7)} \\
\midrule
With AI & 5.79 \\
No AI & 5.50 \\
Integrated & 6.03 \\
Segmented & 5.56 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mental Effort by Condition}
\end{table}

\textbf{Mixed ANOVA (Structure $\times$ Timing):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timing: $F(2, 42.24) = 1.50$, $p = .236$ (ns)
    \item Structure: $F(1, 22) = 2.43$, $p = .133$ (ns)
    \item Interaction: $F(2, 42.16) = 2.32$, $p = .111$ (ns)
\end{itemize}

Mental effort does not differ by timing condition, ruling it out as an explanation for the timing effect on MCQ.

\textbf{Implication:} The timing effect on MCQ is not due to participants \textit{working harder} in pre-reading conditions. Instead, it reflects \textbf{qualitative differences in encoding} (schema activation, organization) rather than quantitative differences in effort expenditure.

\textbf{Ruling Out Desirable Difficulties:} The finding also rules out that pre-reading creates ``desirable difficulties''---the benefit comes from facilitation, not from increased challenge.

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Secondary Finding G: Calibration Is Poor But AI Doesn't Worsen It}
% --------------------------------------------

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Measure} & \textbf{Recall Confidence (1--7)} \\
\midrule
With AI & 4.25 \\
No AI & 4.08 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Confidence by AI Condition}
\end{table}

\textbf{Independent samples t-test for overconfidence:} $t(31.7) = 0.16$, $p = .873$

\textbf{Conclusion:} AI does not inflate confidence beyond actual performance. Both groups show similarly poor calibration.

\textbf{Theoretical Connections:}\\[0.3cm]
\textbf{Metacognitive Monitoring} \citep{koriat1997,nelson1990}: The ability to accurately assess one's own knowledge is a key metacognitive skill. Poor calibration (overconfidence) is common in educational settings.

\textbf{AI and Metacognition:} Importantly, AI assistance does \textit{not exacerbate} overconfidence. This suggests that AI summaries don't create an ``illusion of knowing'' beyond what naturally occurs without AI.

\textbf{Fluency-Based Metacognition:} If AI summaries made content feel ``too easy,'' we would expect inflated confidence. The null effect suggests participants maintain realistic (if imperfect) calibration despite AI assistance.
