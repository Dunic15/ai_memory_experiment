Article 3 (Urban Heat Islands) - pre-reading mode:
  Recall Text:
    'The urban heat island effect is derived from the absorption during the day of solar radiation by urban materials like concrete and asphalt and a slow irradiation during the night which can increase the average temperature in an urbanised area by 3-7 degrees celsius compared to a rural one'
    'The main strategies to combat it are through natural ventilation, cooling, evotranspiration'
    'Trees are the best counteractors to the heat island effect as their effect is most impactful on a human scale'
