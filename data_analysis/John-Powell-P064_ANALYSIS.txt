3) Recall Quality:
   • Consistent 3-sentence recalls (34–44 words per article).
   • High confidence (5–7/7) with moderate-to-high perceived difficulty (5–6/7).
   • CRISPR block shows 2 paste attempts and 3 duplicate submissions (technical artifact).

4) MCQ Performance:
   • Range 66.7%–100.0% (well above 25% chance).
   • Best on Semiconductors (100%).

5) Data Quality:
   • Appropriate reading times, genuine recall, complete phases.
   • Duplicated CRISPR sections and duplicate reading_complete entries flagged but consolidated.

DATA VALIDITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
VALID DATA — High-quality participant response.

Strengths:
  • Appropriate reading times and high engagement
  • Substantive recall responses
  • Strong MCQ performance (77.3% average)
