Article 1 (CRISPR) - pre-reading mode:
  Recall Text:
    'CRISPR technology came from bacteria defending against viruses'
    'CRISPR is a much faster and more cost efficient gene editing tool compared to old tools'
    'Despite it's efficiency, it faces challenges, a few include accuracy and delivery'
    'CRISPR sometimes cuts and edits the wrong genes, but more tools are being developed to fix that by using predictive algorithms and more precise gene locators'
    'CRISPR can't always be deployed easily'
    'CRISPR have many ethical quesiton related to health and ecology'

Article 2 (Semiconductors) - post-reading mode:
  Recall Text:
    'Semiconductor is the foundation of modern society but it's fragile'
    'It is subject to a lot of factors that make it suspetible to damage.'
    'The main limits are inflexibility of production rate, monopoly and single node supply chain,'

Article 3 (Urban Heat Islands) - synchronous mode:
  Recall Text:
    'Urban Heat Islands is a serious issue, and it needs to be studied'
    'It is cause mainly by three things, low albedo material, high heat capacity material, and bad reflective geometry'
    'Low albedo material like asphalt means sunlight energy does not get reflected'
    'High heat capacity materials traps the heat that is absorbed and keeps urban area hot long after the sun sets'
    'The geometry of the cities, and buildings trap heat'
    'The issue it causes are high energy cooling cost, inequity, health care issues'
    'cooling down hot area creeat even more energy released into the atomsphere'
    'people are at risk of heat related illness poorer areas espeically so when they don't get health care'
    'we can fix it by using high albedo material'
    'add vegetation to area'
