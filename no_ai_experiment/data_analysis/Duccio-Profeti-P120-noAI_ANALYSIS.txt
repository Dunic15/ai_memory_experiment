================================================================================
DATA VALIDITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
QUESTIONABLE DATA - Review required

Strengths:
  - High engagement (95%+ scroll depth)
  - Complete data for all phases

Minor Issues:
  - Semiconductors: Page visibility changes (participant may have switched tabs)
Suspiciously short reading times detected
All recall responses are very short (<10 words)

Recommendation: REVIEW before inclusion
  - Data quality concerns require investigation
  - May need to exclude from main analysis
